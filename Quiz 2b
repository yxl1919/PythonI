Question 3
Which of the following are valid ways of defining and using a label?

Note that ellipses denote code that is omitted from and irrelevant for the question. Feel free to fill in plausible parameters and test each choice in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

import simplegui
frame = simplegui.create_frame(...)
frame.add_label("Label one")
frame.add_label("Label two")
Correct	4.00	

import simplegui
f = simplegui.create_frame(...)
label = f.add_label("My label")
label.set_text("My new label")
Correct	4.00	

import simplegui

def label_handler():
    print "Handler called."

f = simplegui.create_frame(...)
f.add_label("My label",label_handler)
Correct	1.00	
This is not a valid way to add a label. Labels don't have handlers.


import simplegui
simplegui.create_frame(...)
l1 = simplegui.add_label("Label one")
l2 = simplegui.add_label("Label two")
Correct	1.00	
This is not a valid way to add a label. It's not simplegui.add_label.

Question 4
When you enter text into an input field and press enter, the text is passed to the input field's event handler. What is the data type of the text?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
A string or a number, depending on the text entered			
A string	Correct	10.00	
The entered data is a string. The text entered into an input field is always passed to the input handler as a string even if the text corresponds to a number.

A number

Question 5
Consider the following conditional statement.

if p == False:
    return False
elif q == False:
    return False
else:
    return True
That is equivalent to which of the following simpler statements?

Try to reason logically about each of the statements, but also try each in CodeSkulptor.

Question 6
Which of the following describes the mistake in the following code?

def volume_cube(side):
    """ Returns the volume of a cube, given the length of its side. """
    print side ** 3

s = 5
print "The volume of a cube with sides", s, "long is", volume_cube(s), "."
Your Answer		Score	Explanation

The call to volume_cube shouldn't be within a print statement. More generally, function calls usually shouldn't be within print statements.


The function should return, not print, its result.

Correct	10.00	
Correct. In most cases, functions should return their computed results. Furthermore, the documentation string here specifies that it should be returning that value.


All of the printing should be done within the function.

Question 7
What kind of errors can happen if you are missing a needed global declaration in one of your function definitions? For this question, you need only consider the case where the problem is in the function that is missing the global declaration.

If you are having trouble with this question, watch this week's Programming Tips video again.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
An incorrect computation that generates no error message	Correct	4.00	
If you only assign to the variable, without trying to use its current value, you won't get any error message. Instead, Python assumes the variable is local, which might lead to an unexpected result.

NameError	Correct	0.67	
SyntaxError	Correct	0.67	
Error: local variable '…' referenced before assignment	Correct	4.00	
AttributeError	Correct	0.67

Question 8
Which of the following function definitions are in the recommended code style?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

def my_function(x, y):
    """ Add the two inputs. """
    return x + y
Inorrect	0.00	

def f(x, y):
    """ Add the two inputs. """
    return x+y
Inorrect	0.00	
This does not follow recommended style, there should be spaces around the addition operator.


def f(x,y):
    """ Add the two inputs. """
    return x + y
Correct	1.00	
This does not follow recommended style, there should be a space after the comma.


def f (x, y):
    """ Add the two inputs. """
    return x + y
Correct	1.00	
This does not follow recommended style, there shouldn't be a space before the parenthesis.

Question 9
Cut and paste the following code into CodeSkulptor. Run it and make an attempt to understand how it works.

# Simple interactive application

import simplegui

# Define globals.

message = "Welcome!"
count = 0

# Define event handlers.

def button_handler():
    """Count number of button presses."""
    global count
    count += 1
    print message,"  You have clicked", count, "times."
    
def input_handler(text):
    """Get text to be displayed."""
    global message
    message = text

# Create frame and register event handlers.

frame = simplegui.create_frame("Home", 100, 200)
frame.add_button("Click me", button_handler)
frame.add_input("New message:", input_handler, 100)

# Start frame.

frame.start()
We'd like to modify the code so that the count is reset to zero whenever a new message is entered. Where would you need to modify this code to implement this change?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

Add an assignment to count at the end of this code.


Add an assignment to count in the initialization of global variables.


Add an assignment to count in the event handler for the button.


Add an assignment to count in the event handler for the input field. Also add a global count declaration there.
