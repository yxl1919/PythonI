Question 3
What happens if you draw text outside the canvas coordinates?

Try it in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Causes an error			
Some or none of the text is shown. Conceptually, the text is drawn at whatever coordinates are given, but only whatever text fits within the canvas coordinates is shown.	Correct	10.00	
The text coordinates are implicitly “wrapped” around using modular arithmetic, so that the text appears on the canvas			
The text appears in the frame, but some or all of the text is shown outside the canvas area.

Question 4
Assume we have a canvas that is 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. We want to draw a green line between the upper left corner and the lower right corner. Which of the following calls will accomplish this?

Try the code in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
canvas.draw_line((0, 0), (299, 199), 10, "Green")	Correct	1.00	
canvas.draw_line((299, 0), (0, 199), 10, "Green")	Correct	1.00	
canvas.draw_line((199, 299), (0, 0), 10, "Green")	Correct	8.00	
Total		10.00 / 10.00	
Question Explanation

A common mistake on this problem is to use a frame that is the same size as the default CodeSkuptor demo (300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high).
Question 5
Consider the following function definition.

def date(month, day):
    """
    Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day.
    """
    return month + "/" + day

print date(2, 12)
This definition leads to an error. To fix it, what Python expression should replace the question marks below?

def date(month, day):
    """
    Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day.
    """
    return ???

print date(2, 12)
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
string(month) + "/" + string(day)			
string(month / day)			
string(month + "/" + day)			
str(month / day)			
str(month + "/" + day)			
str(month) + "/" + str(day)	Correct	10.00

Question 6
How many instances of the letter "l" are there in the following:

1lll1l1l1l1ll1l111ll1l1ll1l1ll1ll111ll1ll1ll1l1ll1ll1ll1ll1lll1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1ll1lll1l111ll1l1l1l1l1
Although it might be hard to tell, that string contains ones (1) and lower-case L's (l). Create a small CodeSkulptor program, and use copy-and-paste to put this string in your code. Your program should only need one function or method call.

Question 10
The following is a diagram of an archery target.

Archery target, which is a set of concentric circles, with the innermost being yellow, and the outermost being white
To draw this in CodeSkulptor, we can put a small yellow circle with a black border on top of a slightly bigger yellow circle with a black border, … on top of a big white circle with a black border. In what order should your code draw these circles?
